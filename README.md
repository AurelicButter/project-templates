# Project Templates
My template repository for new projects

Use the launch.bat file to get started to automatically generate a GitHub repository with one of the project templates. Requires SVN, Git, and GitHub CLI to function.

`launch.bat <project name> <project type> <is public (optional)>` in the terminal or
`launch.bat` anywhere you can for user prompts

Will also ask for a local directory to place the repository and a description for GitHub.
